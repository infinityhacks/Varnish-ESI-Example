# Varnish ESI Example

This bunch of files should help you to setup a _Proof of Concept (POC)_ about Varnish cache and ESI.  
It has been tested with `varnish-3.0.2` on Mac OSX 10.7.

## Prerequisites

If not already done, you need to install :

* Apache2
* PHP5
* Varnish 

## Setup

1. Clone the project !  
`git clone git@github.com:tomav/Varnish-ESI-Example.git`

2. Edit your `/etc/hosts`  
Add a new line `127.0.0.1  varnish-esi-example`

3. Edit `Varnish-ESI-Example/apache/varnish-esi-example.conf`  
Adapt the `DocumentRoot` and `CustomLog` to match `Varnish-ESI-Example/www` folder located in the package.

4. Load the backend VirtualHost in Apache  
`sudo ln -s /this/should/be/replaced/to/match/Varnish-ESI-Example/apache/varnish-esi-example.conf /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/`  
`sudo apache2ctl restart`

5. Edit Varnish configuration file `Varnish-ESI-Example/varnish/varnish-esi-example.vcl`  
Adapt `/this/should/be/replaced/to/match/` occurrences to match files located in `Varnish-ESI-Example/varnish` folder.

6. Start Varnish (but adapt the command line before, like in previous step)  
`sudo varnishd -a varnish-esi-example:8080 -T localhost:6082 -f /this/should/be/replaced/to/match/Varnish-ESI-Example/varnish/varnish-esi-example.vcl -s file,/opt/local/var/varnish/varnish-esi-example.bin,10M`

## Play

Your static website should be available at [http://varnish-esi-example/](http://varnish-esi-example/). It uses PHP includes to load `lorem.php` and `footer.php`, and the page is served by Apache. (Varnish is not used at this time, so no cache).

Your proxied website should be available at [http://varnish-esi-example:8080/](http://varnish-esi-example:8080). Same as above, but received by Varnish, and processed by Apache. PHP includes are used, no ESI yet. Again, no cache at this time. (not used in the tests)

Your cached website should be available at [http://varnish-esi-example:8080/?esi](http://varnish-esi-example:8080/?esi). Here, ESI is used and cache is  used on `lorem.php` and `footer.php` files. The first file contains a `sleep(1)` PHP instruction to simulate a 1 second _[Time To First Byte (TTFB)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_To_First_Byte)_. The second is cached 24 hours.

Your full cached website should be available at [http://varnish-esi-example:8080/?full](http://varnish-esi-example:8080/?full). Here, ESI is used and cache is  used on all page includes. 

The `Ã¬ndex.php` file contains :

* a `meta-refresh` to let you see what is changing every 2 seconds
* the time appears in the center and right column. You will see that `/lorem.php` is cached 10 seconds via ESI.  
* the `/footer.php` file is cached 24 hours but you can purge it manually via a link which call `/purge.php` (modify the text of the file, then click "pruge").

Note : The cache _Time To Live (TTL)_ is configurable in `varnish-esi-example-fetch.vcl` for both `lorem.php` and `footer.php` files.

Now, play with `ab` and check `Varnish-ESI-Example/www/varnish-esi-example-access_log` to see when Apache is reached.

## Results

The following tests are focused on PHP files, not statics like JS/CSS.
1000 hits with 10 concurrent queries.

### Apache only : no cache and 1s TTFB every page load  
    ab -n 1000 -c 10 http://varnish-esi-example/
